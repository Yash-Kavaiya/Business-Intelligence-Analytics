### What is Intelligence 
Intelligence has been defined in many ways. It is often described as the ability to learn, understand, or deal with new or trying situations, or the skill of using reason and knowledge¹. It involves the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It can also be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. In other words, it's the capacity for learning, reasoning, understanding, and similar forms of mental activity.

Sure, here are some examples of intelligent and non-intelligent behaviors. Please note that intelligence is a complex trait and these are just simplified examples:

| Intelligent Behavior | Non-Intelligent Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Learning a new language | 1. Repeating the same mistake |
| 2. Solving a complex mathematical problem | 2. Ignoring evidence or facts |
| 3. Adapting to a new environment | 3. Unable to adapt to change |
| 4. Creating a piece of art or music | 4. Lack of creativity or originality |
| 5. Making informed decisions based on data | 5. Making decisions based on superstitions |
| 6. Understanding and managing emotions (Emotional Intelligence) | 6. Reacting impulsively without considering consequences |
| 7. Planning for the future | 7. Failing to plan or set goals |
| 8. Understanding others' perspectives (Empathy) | 8. Ignoring others' feelings or perspectives |
| 9. Self-awareness and self-improvement | 9. Lack of self-awareness or unwillingness to improve |
| 10. Critical thinking and problem-solving | 10. Accepting information without questioning |

**Business Intelligence (BI)** refers to the procedural and technical infrastructure that collects, stores, and analyzes the data produced by a company's activities⁵. It encompasses data mining, process analysis, performance benchmarking, and descriptive analytics⁵. BI tools parse all the data generated by a business and present easy-to-digest reports, performance measures, and trends that inform management decisions⁵. It seeks to increase the accuracy, timeliness, and amount of data, making broad analysis possible⁵.

**Business Analytics (BA)** refers to the skills, technologies, and practices for iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning³. It involves taking in and processing historical business data, analyzing that data to identify trends, patterns, and root causes, and making data-driven business decisions based on those insights¹. It uses four primary methods: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive².

While both BI and BA analyze data to solve business problems, the difference lies in how data is used. BI is concerned with extracting meaningful insights from and visualizing data to facilitate the decision-making process, whereas BA is focused on making sense of raw data using algorithms, statistical models, and computer programming².

### Why Data is new oil ?
The phrase "Data is the new oil" is often used to highlight the value and importance of data in today's digital age¹²³⁴. Here are a few reasons why data is often compared to oil:

1. **Valuable Resource**: Just like oil, data has become one of the most valuable resources in the world¹²³⁴. 

2. **Raw to Refined**: Raw data, like crude oil, isn't valuable in itself. The value is created when it is gathered quickly, completely, accurately, and connected to other relevant data³⁴.

3. **Powering Innovation**: Data powers the information economy in the same way oil powers the industrial economy¹²³⁴.

4. **Business Insights**: Data provides valuable insights that can lead to improved decision-making and forecasting, much like oil can be refined into fuel and various other useful products¹²³⁴.

5. **Economic Impact**: The economic impact of data is enormous and continues to grow, similar to the impact of oil during the industrial revolution.

However, it's important to note that while the analogy helps to convey the importance of data, data and oil have fundamentally different economic factors. Misapplying the analogy could undercut our ability to use data for the benefit of all.

### Acquisitions in the digital world

There have been numerous significant acquisitions in the digital world. Here are a few examples:

1. **Google Acquires Fitbit**: Google acquired fitness tracker favorite Fitbit for $2.1 billion¹.
2. **Apple Buys Beats by Dre**: Apple's 2014 deal to buy Beats is the most expensive acquisition in the company's history¹.
3. **Google Acquires Nest**: Google brought Nest in-house in a $3.2 billion deal¹.
4. **Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard**: Microsoft announced the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for US$68.7 billion².
5. **Dell acquired EMC**: Dell announced the acquisition of data storage company EMC, for US$ 67 billion².
6. **Elon Musk acquired Twitter**: Elon Musk acquired Twitter in an all-cash deal worth $44 billion².
7. **Avago Technologies acquired Broadcom**: Avago Technologies acquired its rival Broadcom for $37 billion².
