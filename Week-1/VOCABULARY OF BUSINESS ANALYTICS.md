## Vocabulary
Sure, let's break down these terms:

1. **Data Warehousing**: It's like a big storage unit for data. It stores a huge amount of data, typically collected from multiple sources like files, databases, etc. The goal is to produce statistical results that may help in decision-making⁴.

2. **Data Marts**: These are like smaller, specialized sections within the big storage unit (data warehouse). They focus on a specific area or department within an organization, providing a simplified and targeted view of data¹³.

3. **Databases**: These are organized collections of data stored in a computer system. They store data in tables, making it easy to query and process the data³³.

4. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: This is a process that extracts data from different sources, transforms it (like cleaning or formatting), and then loads it into a data warehouse or other system³⁷.

5. **Big Data**: This refers to a great quantity of diverse information that arrives in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity³.

6. **Data Engineering**: This is the process of organizing, managing, and analyzing large amounts of data²⁵.

7. **Data Mining**: This is the process of extracting knowledge or insights from large amounts of data using various statistical and computational techniques⁹.

8. **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**: This is the process of discovering useful knowledge from a collection of data²².

9. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: This is software for performing multidimensional analysis at high speeds on large volumes of data from a data warehouse, data mart, or some other unified, centralized data store¹⁸.

10. **Analytics**: This is the process of discovering, interpreting, and communicating significant patterns in data²⁹.

11. **Advanced Analytics**: This involves the use of advanced techniques and tools for predictive and prescriptive data analysis.

12. **DSS (Decision Support Systems)**: These are computer-based information systems that support business or organizational decision-making activities.

13. **Business Intelligence/Data Science**: These are practices for collecting, analyzing, and presenting business data to help make better business decisions.

The other terms seem to be either incomplete or not standard terms in data science. If you could provide more context or clarification, I'd be happy to help further!

## Course Philosophy
Some companies have built their very businesses on
their ability to collect, analyze and act on data. Every
company can learn from what these companies do.
--Thomas Davenport, Competing on Analytics, HBR Jan 2006

The use of management science tools and models
represents the future of best-practices for tomorrow's
successful companies. When used wisely, these models
and tools have enormous power to enhance the
competitiveness of almost any company or enterprise.
It is therefore imperative that tomorrow's business
leaders be well-versed in the modeling techniques and
also in the software skills to develop and use the
models.
-- Freund, R. and Wang Y., MIT Sloan School of Management, 2003.
